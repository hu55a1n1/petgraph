/// [Generic] Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
///
/// Compute the length of the shortest path from `start` to every reachable
/// node, as well as the shortest path tree.
///
/// The graph should be `Visitable` and implement `IntoEdges`. The function
/// `edge_cost` should return the cost for a particular edge, which is used
/// to compute path costs. Edge costs must be non-negative.
///
/// If `goal` is not `None`, then the algorithm terminates once the `goal` node's
/// cost is calculated.
///
/// Returns a tuple containing:
///
/// * `HashMap` that maps `NodeId` to path cost. The shortest path weight is the sum of the edge
/// weights along the shortest path.
/// * `HashMap` that maps each `NodeId` to its predecessor. The predecessor map records the edges
/// in the shortest path tree, the tree computed by the traversal of the graph.
/// Upon completion of the algorithm, the edges *(p[u],u)* for all *u* in *V* are in the tree.
/// The shortest path from vertex *s* to each vertex *v* in the graph consists of the vertices
/// *v, p[v], p[p[v]],* and so on until *s* is reached, in reverse order.
/// The tree is not guaranteed to be a minimum spanning tree. If *p[u]* does not exist, it is
/// either because u has not been visited as the algorithm
/// stopped or that it is not reachable from the source.
